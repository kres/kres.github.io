This is my first post on this blog :D  As we programers always do, I will start with a **Hello World** program!

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
	printf("Hello World!\n");
	return 0;
}
```

-----------------------------

**In some python now**

```python
print "Hello World"
```
yes, I just could not leave out **python**!
